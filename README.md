# Aggregate_size_statistics
This is a blob detection algorithm that detect quantum dots aggregates and output their size histogram.
After binary masking it asign an integer to each blob. Each pixel of the blob get it integer. Then by summing how many times each integer is appear we get the area (pixels) of each blob.
